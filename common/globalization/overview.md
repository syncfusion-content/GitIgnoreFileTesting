# Globalization

Globalization is the combination of adapting the control to various languages by parsing and formatting the date or numbers (Internationalization (L18N)) and adding cultural-specific customizations and translating the text (Localization (L10N)). The Syncfusion Angular UI components are specific to the `American English (en-US)` culture by default.

The globalization in Syncfusion Angular UI is enabled by

* [Localization](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/common/globalization/localization) - It allows you to localize the text content of the Syncfusion Angular UI Components.

* [Internalization](../../common/internationalization/) - It provides support for formatting and parsing date and number objects.
