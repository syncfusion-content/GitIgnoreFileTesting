# How to use Custom CSS File in Angular Application

This guide explains the process of using custom styles generated by the [Theme Editor](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/themestudio/?theme=material) in an Angular application that uses Essential JS2 Angular components.

## Create an Angular application

Follow the [documentation](../../getting-started/angular-cli) to create an Angular application that includes Essential JS2 Angular components.

## Generating custom CSS file

Use the [theme-studio](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/themestudio/?theme=material) to generate a custom CSS file.

## Adding custom CSS in Angular application

Place the generated custom CSS file inside the `./src/` directory of your Angular application.

## Custom style mapping

In the `./angular.json` file, add the path to the custom CSS file under the `architect/build/options/styles` property, as shown below,

```typescript
"styles": [
             "src/styles.css",
             "src/custom-material.css"
          ],
```

## Run Angular application

Start the Angular application and the Essential JS2 Angular components will now display with the custom styles.
