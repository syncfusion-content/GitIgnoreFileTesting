## Installing Package

Syncfusion Angular UI Component (Essential JS 2) packages are published in [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=ej2-angular&page=1&ranking=optimal).
You can install the necessary packages from npmâ€™s install command.
For example, grid package can be installed using following command.

```sh
npm install @syncfusion/ej2-angular-grids --save
```

## Install by using `package.json`

1. Add the Syncfusion Angular (Essential JS 2) package references in the `dependencies` of `~/package.json` file.

        "dependencies": {
            "@syncfusion/ej2-angular-grids": "*"
        }
    }
    ```
    > The `*` indicates the latest version of npm package. Refer the [documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/semver#versions) for more details about npm versioning.
